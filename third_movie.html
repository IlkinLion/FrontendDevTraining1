    <p>Raiders of the Lost Ark is a 1981 American action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by
        Lawrence Kasdan, based on a story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman.
        It stars Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, Ronald Lacey, John Rhys-Davies, and Denholm Elliott. Ford
        portrays Indiana Jones, a globe-trotting archaeologist vying with Nazi German
        forces in 1936 to recover the long-lost Ark of the Covenant, a relic said to make an army invincible. Teaming up
        with his tough former lover Marion Ravenwood (Allen), Jones races to stop
        rival archaeologist Dr. Ren√© Belloq (Freeman) from guiding the Nazis to the Ark and its power.</p>
